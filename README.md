# SHOOTY SHOOTY

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of Corona, we thought about it this way: What if we turned social distancing into a space shooter?

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it: Power ups, proper looking assets, implementing sound, visibility of the bullets, implementing particles, making sections of the background to make a whole background.

These are the technologies and resources we used: Piskel, Godot Engine, Audacity, Reason, Freesound.

This is the objective of the game: Shoot as many infected people as you can with Lysol to avoid getting COVID-19.

This is how the game is played: WASD to move, space/LMB to shoot.

Future plans: We will let it die.
