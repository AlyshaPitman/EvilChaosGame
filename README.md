# SHOOTY SHOOTY
## by Team EvilChaos
### For BL-MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, Bloomington
### April 29, 2020

---

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of corona, we thought about it this way: what if we turned social distancing into a space shooter?

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it: Power ups, proper looking assets, implementing sound, visibility of the bullets, implementing particles

These are the technologies and resources we used: piskel, godot engine, audacity, reason

This is the objective of the game: shoot as many infected people as you can with lysol before getting the corona virus

This is how the game is played: WASD to move, space/LMB to shoot

Future plans:
